## Foam Tiles
Sound Treatment is Not Soundproofing

Sound treatment is different from soundproofing. The goal of soundproofing is to block sound transmission from one place to another one. I giggle at the silliness when I read complaints that people try to block the sound of a neighbor’s dog barking by putting these acoustic panels to hang in front of their windows. That will not work at all. Soundproofing is a reconstruction project because soundproof foam does not exist.

**Pyrmids** 
They reduce both echos and background noises.
You can cut and shape the panels without affecting their noise reduction.


**Egg Crate Design**

What’s special about them?

    The egg-crate design is very efficient for sound absorption.
    You can easily attach the soundproofing tiles to your walls or ceiling
    The two-inch thickness reduces reverb and reflections, especially in the mid- to high-frequency range.

Best for: covering the ceiling, especially if it is not parallel to the floor because of the angular reflection of sound that will be bouncing back from the ceiling to walls. The lightweight nature of foam makes it easy to apply acoustic tiles to the ceiling or any other surface.
